Windows Form Application (WFA)

- WFA use a lot of partial class
- Partial class  provides a special ability to implement the functionality of a single class into multiple files and 
  all these files are combined into a single class file when the application is compiled.
- In windows form there are two Dashboard class to sepearte  display code and  form logic code. At the end compiler compiles these two classes.
- In our demo app, public partial class Dashboard: Form => form logic code && public class Dashboard => display code

- Try to put the user interface code in its own class and others in class library so that we can replace
  the app with any user interface in the future.

Pro Tip: Get to know winforms because they are easy and still in use but dont stay there.
